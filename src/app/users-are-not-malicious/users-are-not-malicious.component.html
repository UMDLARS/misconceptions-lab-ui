    <p>A classic mistake that programmers often make is to assume that people will only use their systems as the
      programmers expect them to. This assumption allows programmers to ignore issues that could arise from a system
      being used in an unexpected way. Unfortunately, this is a dangerous assumption. In reality, not all users are
      benevolent or act in good faith; some of them are actively malicious, looking for ways to exploit systems for
      their own benefit. Some users are unauthorized, perhaps having gained access to the system through another
      vulnerability, but sometimes authorized users have bad intentions (this is also known as an “insider attack”).
      Additionally, sometimes users are acting in good faith, but do things that the programmer did not anticipate,
      resulting in unexpected outcomes that can leak or corrupt data, damage hardware, deny service, or have other
      negative effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution to this problem is well-known, and takes the form of input validation and input sanitization.
      Input validation is making sure that input matches a required form or type. For example, ensuring that input
      meant to be a number is composed only of digits and not any other symbols. Input sanitization takes valid input
      and ensures that the input cannot do anything malicious or undesired. For example, input sanitization for an
      online “comment section” is responsible for making sure that HTML entered into a comment is shown as HTML in the
      comment, and not interpreted as HTML, which would modify the web page.

<!--      Examples of this misconception in the wild.-->

    <h5> Code Injection </h5>
    <p>
      In an old-school attack known as Code Injection, users purposefully paste a block of code into a web form input
      field where a developer would never expect code to exist.  This <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/" target="_blank">
      XKCD comic </a> explores how user input can destroy a database.
      For further reading here is an <a
      href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Little_Bobby_Tables" target="_blank"> explanation</a> of the
      XKCD comic.
    </p>
    <h5> Buffer Overflow </h5>
    <p>
      A buffer overflow attack closely mimics a code injection attack.  In this scenario, a user exploits the limited
      size of memory given to a function.  The very last line of code in a function is the return address, which tells
      the computer where the next executable code exists.  If a user writes a large piece of executable code in a
      buffer, then keeps writing beyond the end of that buffer, they can possibly overwrite the return address.  If
      they rewrite the return address to point to the beginning of their injected code, the computer will execute
      everything the user wrote!  Read more about buffer overflows

    <h5> Samy Worm </h5>
    <p>
      Back in the days of MySpace, a 20-year-old named Samy Kamkar launched a successful cross-site scripting attack
      known as the "Samy Worm," which created a pop-up saying "but most of all, Samy is my hero" and automatically sent
      Samy a friend request.  While the vulnerability lay within web browsers, MySpace took most of the heat and
      eventually found a way to patch the bug themselves.  Samy released an explanation of the exploit, which is archived <a
      href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305044015/http://samy.pl/popular/tech.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

    In this activity, you play the role of a user of a fabulous new android, the BakeBot 5000 -- a robot capable of
    parsing recipes written in a special language and baking splendiferous comestibles. Unfortunately, the original
    developer of the BakeBot made the assumption that, since people would never ask BakeBot to do anything weird, the
    developer didn’t need to protect BakeBot from any kind of edge cases resulting from malicious or unexpected input.
    Your task is to find all the ways that BakeBot can be misused. Each time you find something bad that BakeBot can
    do, you can set a constraint that is used to make sure that BakeBot’s input fits within the required parameter.
    Once you’ve found all the edge cases and set all the constraints, you’ve completed the activity!
