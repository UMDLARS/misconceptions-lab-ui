  <div intro>
    <p>People who hold this misconception trust that users or other “upstream” data sources will only provide harmless
    input. Users - either purposely or just through chance - may provide input that breaks the expected flow of the
    program. However, instead of trusting input, if input is treated as malicious “until proven innocent” by validating
    and sanitizing it before use, dangerous input cannot cause bad outcomes. Additionally, because of this process,
    normal users with unusual input are likely to get a better experience, as the program will always perform as
      expected.</p>

    <p>Users may use a system in a certain way and break it as a result. User input is a form of user interaction
      that creates vulnerabilities. A user may unintentionally or maliciously break a system exploiting vulnerabilities
      like for example a <a href="https://medium.com/@amannagpal4/buffer-overflow-attack-and-its-evolution-519db3c396ad"

      Examples of this misconception in the wild.

    <p>
      With code insertion, a user can inject malicious code into a system by submitting code into a user inout field
      as opposed to what the developer expects. This <a
      href="https://xkcd.com/327/" target="_blank"> XKCD comic </a> explores how user input can destroy a database.
      For further reading here is an <a
